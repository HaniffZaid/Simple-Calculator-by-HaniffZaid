# ðŸ§® - Simple Calculator by HaniffZaid

The project aims to develop a straightforward user interface (UI) using Tkinter, which is a popular GUI toolkit for Python. The initial concept is inspired by a tutorial from the YouTube channel Parvat Computer Technology, where basic UI elements and functionalities are demonstrated.

To customize the project further, the author is integrating their own preferences and design choices, moving beyond the original tutorial. This includes experimenting with various widgets, layout management, and event handling to enhance the user experience.

In addition to following the tutorial, the author is actively consulting the Tkinter documentation. This allows for deeper understanding and implementation of advanced features, such as styling options, responsiveness, and interactive components. Overall, the project represents an evolving journey in mastering Tkinter while creating a user-friendly application tailored to the authorâ€™s vision.
